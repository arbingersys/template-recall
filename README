Template-Recall
============================

Template::Recall works using a "reverse callback" approach. A "callback" 
templating system (i.e. Mason, Apache::ASP) generally includes template 
markup and code in the same file. The template "calls" out to the code 
where needed. Template::Recall works in reverse. Rather than inserting 
code inside the template, the template remains separate, but broken into
sections. The sections are called from within the code at the 
appropriate times.

A template section is merely a file on disk (or a "marked" section in a
single file). The render() method is used to "call" out to the template 
sections. Simply create a hash of name/value pairs that represent the 
template tags you wish to replace, and pass it along with the template 
section, i.e.

        $tr->render('prodrow', \%h);
